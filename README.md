Important to know about the old doener
  
1. if you dont have steam client installed on your pc the stealer wont work (that why virtual machine's dont work).
  
2. if you want the crypto clipper feature | open the stub.js with txt or whatever, press "ctrl" + "f" and past this "base32" decrypt the encoded value and replace it with your adresses.

3. dualhooked files (stub.js, cryptertele.js, crypter.js, wallet injection, script_build.js)
