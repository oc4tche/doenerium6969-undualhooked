💎 FIX DETECTS AND UPDATE WALLET INJECT AT 50 MEMBERS ON TELEGRAM 😉

## important to know!!
1. if u dont have steam client installed on ur pc the stealer wont work (that why vm's dont work)
2. if u want the crypto clipper feature | open the stub.js with txt or whatever;  press "ctrl" + "f" and past this "base32" decrypt the encoded value and replace with ur adresses
thats it for now.
